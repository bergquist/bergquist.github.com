title: How to extend an array with an array in javascript
---

I was working on a small side project where I wanted to extend and javascript array with another javascript array. I found this Stackoverflow question an it put a smile on my face because I think this is a good example of the power javascript provides.

I'm gonna try to explain how it works.
push() adds and element to an array ex

var a = [ 1, 2 ]
a.push(3)
a
>>> [ 1, 2, 3 ]

But you can also give push more parameters. ex

var a = [ 1, 2 ]
a.push(3, 4)
a
>>> [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

What apply does is that it allow you to execute an mehtod on another object. ex
var sparkles = {
	name: 'Sparkles',
	sayHello: function() {
		console.log('Hi. My name is ' + this.name)
	}
}

var rainbowdash = {
    name: 'rainbowdash'
}

sparkles.sayHello.apply(rainbowdash);
>>> 'Hi. My name is rainbowdash'

You can also provide arguments for the method by passing a second parameters.
The second parameters should be an array of parameters

var sparkles = {
	name: 'Sparkles',
	sayHello: function(greetingPhrase, whoToGreet) {
		console.log(greetingPhrase + ' ' + whoToGreet + '. My name is ' + this.name)
	}
}

sparkles.sayHallo.apply(rainbowdash, [ 'Hi', sparkles' ])
>>> 'Hi sparkles. My name is rainbowdash'


So what happens is..

a.push.apply(a, b) turns into a.push(4, 5, 6)

Awesome!
