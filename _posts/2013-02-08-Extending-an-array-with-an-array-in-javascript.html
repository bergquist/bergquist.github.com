title: How to extend an array with an array in javascript
---

I was working on a small side project where I wanted to extend and javascript array with another javascript array. So I found this Stackoverflow question an it put a smile on my face because I think this is a good example of the power javascript provides.

So I'm gonna try to explain how it works.
push() adds and element to an array ex

var a = [ 1, 2 ]
a.push(3)
a
>>> [ 1, 2, 3 ]

But you can also give push more parameters. ex

var a = [ 1, 2 ]
a.push(3, 4)
a
>>> [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

What apply does is that it allow you to execute an mehtod on another object. ex
var sparkles = {
    name: 'sparkles'
}

var rainbowdash = {
    name: 'rainbowdash'
}
